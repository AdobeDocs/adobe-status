# Adobe Status 1.0 API Support

Find answers to frequently asked questions here.

## Do Adobe Status API's provide  more information than what is available on status.adobe.com?

No. Status API's provide the same information as status.adobe.com. Just like Status.adobe.com allows you to filter events on Cloud and Product pages, the same functionality is available via API's. API's provide you the flexibility to plug that filtered view into your internal dashboards.

## Do I need permissions to access Status API's?

Yes. Your Organization needs to have at least one Adobe product entitlement and your Adobe Developer Console account should be entitled to a Adobe Product. If your account is correctly setup, you should be able to see and add Adobe Status API's to your project.

## What are the setups needed before I can call the API's?

Please refer to the Guides -> Getting Started section of the Status API documentation.

## How can I get an understanding of Adobe Status product taxonomy?

Please refer to the Guides -> Product Hierarchy section.

## Are there any sample code snippets that I can use?

Yes. Please refer to the API Reference menu item for NodeJs and Python code snippets to generate OAuth access token. If you use Postman, you can refer to the Postman Collection section on API Reference for downloadable Postman collection and environment variable files. All API's come with CLI, Javascript, and NodeJS samples.

## How do I get more help if I run into issues?
