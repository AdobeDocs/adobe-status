## Overview

The Adobe Status 1.0 APIs allow you to directly call Adobe's servers to query and view events just like on status.adobe.com UI. You can use these API's to integrate into your own monitoring system or dashboards to view real time events from Adobe Status that can be filtered based on Product, Product Offering, Region, Environment(where available), Locale and Event type. This documentation provides instructions on how to call Adobe's endpoints to return the desired data.
