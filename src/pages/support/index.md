# Adobe Status 1.0 API Support

Find answers to frequently asked questions here.

## Do Adobe Status API's provide  more information than what's available on status.adobe.com?
No. Status API's provide same information as status.adobe.com. Just as Status UI allows you to filer events on Cloud and Product pages, you can do the same via API's. It gives you flexibility to plug that filtered view into your internal dashboards.

## Do I need permissions to access Status API's?
Yes. Your Organization needs to have at least one Adobe product entitlement and your Adobe Developer Console account should be entitled to a Adobe Product. If your account is correctly setup, you should be able to see and add Adobe Status API's to your project.

## What are the setups needed before I can call the API's?
Please refer to the Guides -> Getting Started section of the Status API documentation.

## How can I get understanding of Adobe Status product taxonomy?
Please refer to the Guides -> Product Hierarchy section.

## Are there any sample code snippets that I can use?
Yes. Please refer to API Reference menu item for NodeJs and Python code snippet to generate JWT access token. If you use Postman, you can refer to Postman Collection section on API Reference for a downloadable Postman collection and environment variable files. All API's come with CLI, Javascript and NodeJS samples.
